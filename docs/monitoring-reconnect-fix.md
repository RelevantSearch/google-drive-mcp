# Monitoring the reconnect / trust-proxy fix

After this PR deploys (Cloud Run service `drive-mcp` in `rs-workspace-integrations`), use these queries to verify the fix is actually addressing the user-visible symptoms vs. just changing log shape.

All queries below run via:

```bash
gcloud logging read '<filter>' \
  --project=rs-workspace-integrations \
  --limit=50 \
  --freshness=1d
```

## 1. Confirm trust-proxy is fixed

The `ValidationError: X-Forwarded-For header is set but Express 'trust proxy' setting is false` stream should stop completely after deploy.

```
resource.type="cloud_run_revision"
resource.labels.service_name="drive-mcp"
textPayload=~"ValidationError.*Forwarded"
```

Expected: zero results after the new revision is serving.

## 2. Count stale-session 404s — the path our fix targets

Each emission is a request where the client presented an `Mcp-Session-Id` that the server doesn't recognise. Under the old code this returned 400 and (we believe) drove the "had to reconnect" UX. Under the new code it returns 404 and the MCP client should re-init transparently.

```
resource.type="cloud_run_revision"
resource.labels.service_name="drive-mcp"
textPayload=~"mcp.session.not_found"
```

Each log line includes:
- `method` (POST or GET)
- `sidPrefix` (first 8 chars of the stale session ID; correlates the same client retrying)
- `bodyMethod` (the JSON-RPC method the client was trying to invoke, POST only)
- `ua` (truncated user-agent — `Claude-User`, `python-httpx/...`, etc.)
- `ip` (resolved via `trust proxy: 2` — should be the GCLB-attested client, not a Cloud Run internal)

## 3. Distinguish stale-session from "no session header at all"

Old 400s collapsed both cases. We split them now:

```
resource.type="cloud_run_revision"
resource.labels.service_name="drive-mcp"
textPayload=~"mcp.protocol.no_session"
```

If we see lots of these, the client is sending non-init requests without a session header — different protocol bug, NOT what this fix addresses.

## 4. New session creations + correlation

Every fresh initialize. Lets us count how often re-inits happen and correlate session IDs with user IPs.

```
resource.type="cloud_run_revision"
resource.labels.service_name="drive-mcp"
textPayload=~"mcp.session.created"
```

If the 404 fix is working, you should see a `mcp.session.created` shortly after each `mcp.session.not_found` for the same `ip` — that's the MCP client transparently re-initialising.

## 5. Trust-proxy is resolving `req.ip` correctly post-deploy

Look at any `mcp.session.created` or `mcp.session.not_found` log and verify the `ip` field looks like a real client IP, NOT a `169.254.x.x` or `10.x.x.x` Google internal. If it's internal, the hop count (currently 2) is wrong for our actual deploy chain — adjust and redeploy.

## 6. OAuth refresh-token outcomes

This separates "MCP session reset" (cheap, transparent) from "full OAuth re-auth required" (expensive, user-visible). Currently we cannot tell them apart from logs alone.

```
resource.type="cloud_run_revision"
resource.labels.service_name="drive-mcp"
textPayload=~"oauth.refresh"
```

Events:
- `oauth.refresh.rotated` — happy path, token successfully exchanged.
- `oauth.refresh.grace_hit` — client retried within 5s and we returned the cached pair (good).
- `oauth.refresh.not_found` / `revoked` / `expired` — user will be forced to re-auth (bad UX, but recoverable).
- `oauth.refresh.reuse_detected` — **CRITICAL** — fires when an already-rotated token is presented again. Under `maxScale=1` this should only happen for actual replay attacks. If it fires for legitimate users, the in-process grace cache lost a retry (the exact failure mode that motivates the Firestore-cache follow-up). Each emission revokes the user's entire refresh chain and forces re-auth.

A burst of `oauth.refresh.reuse_detected` correlated with a user's reported reconnect is the smoking gun for the Phase-2 grace-cache bug.

## 7. JWT verification failures

```
resource.type="cloud_run_revision"
resource.labels.service_name="drive-mcp"
textPayload=~"oauth.verify.failed"
```

Normal at JWT expiry (every hour per user). A flood would indicate signing-key issues.

## What "the fix is working" looks like

Within ~hours of deploy:

- `ValidationError` stderr stream: zero.
- `mcp.session.not_found` emissions: present (the spec-compliant code path is exercised).
- For each `mcp.session.not_found` from `Claude-User`, a matching `mcp.session.created` follows within a few seconds from the same `ip`. Means claude.ai's client honored the 404 by re-initialising.
- User reports of "had to reconnect" drop or stop.

## What "the fix is NOT enough" looks like

- `mcp.session.not_found` is rare or absent → our 400→404 path is not where users were hitting. Look at `mcp.protocol.no_session` instead, or check if user reconnects correlate with something else (Cloud Run cold starts, OAuth flow, etc.).
- `mcp.session.not_found` is followed by NO matching `mcp.session.created` → claude.ai's MCP client does not implement spec-required re-init on 404. We need to look at the connector behavior.
- `ip` field shows Google-internal addresses → trust-proxy hop count needs adjustment.
